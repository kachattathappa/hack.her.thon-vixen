### Project Description
[The Railway Checkpoint Monitoring System predicts and displays closure timings of railway crossings based on train schedules. It helps commuters plan better by showing real-time status and providing alerts or map-based updates. The system reduces waiting times and enhances travel convenience near railway crossings.]

### The Problem statement
[Unpredictable railway checkpoint closures cause delays and inconvenience for commuters. A system is needed to predict closures using train schedules and provide real-time alerts to help users plan better and avoid delays.]

### The Solution
[A user friendly app which tackles the daily delay faced  by commuters at the railway checkpoints. Calculating the closure time of the check points effectively saving time.]
