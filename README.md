### Project Description
[The Railway Checkpoint Monitoring System predicts and displays closure timings of railway crossings based on train schedules. It helps commuters plan better by showing real-time status and providing alerts or map-based updates. The system reduces waiting times and enhances travel convenience near railway crossings.]

### The Problem statement
[Unpredictable railway checkpoint closures cause delays and inconvenience for commuters. A system is needed to predict closures using train schedules and provide real-time alerts to help users plan better and avoid delays.]

### The Solution
[A user friendly app which tackles the daily delay faced  by commuters at the railway checkpoints. Calculating the closure time of the check points effectively saving time.]

*Add caption explaining what this shows*
this code depicts the first page of our website containing the web name,logo,dashboard and buttons that will enable the user to select the checkpoint and also allow user to access their current location.(train.html)

*Add caption explaining what this shows*
this one displays the nearby checkpoints and its live status(checkpoint.html)

)

*Add caption explaining what this shows*
this page displays the details regarding the selected checkpoint and also the train details like (name,number,location and arrival time).
we have set the timing constraints and for the gates which are closed, we have added a timer which indicates the next opening time.

# Diagrams
![Workflow](1. User Interface (Frontend):
Home Page

Options:
Manually Enter Checkpoint Name: Allows the user to input a specific checkpoint.
Use Location Tracking: Enables location tracking to display checkpoints near the user.
Nearby Checkpoints Page

Displays a list of checkpoints sorted by distance from the user's location.
Includes live checkpoint statuses (Open/Closed).
Checkpoint Details Page

Shows:
Checkpoint name and live status.
Train schedule passing through the checkpoint.
Distance from the user's location (if applicable).
